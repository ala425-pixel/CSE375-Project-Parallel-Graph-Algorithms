Project Outline:

Test BFS
	Top down version
	Bottom up version
	Hybrid as described in reference [1]
	All implementations found in BFS folder

Test SSPD
	Dijkstra's Algorithm
		
	Bellman-Ford
	Stepping Algorithm Framework
		Delta*-stepping, rho-stepping, and bellman-ford all found in ssss.h file

Additional Implementation Details:
	Dijkstra implementation uses std::priority_queue
	The other sssp algorithms use the data structure found in hashbag.h
	I'm not sure what this is

	Graphs are stored as .adj or .bin files
	The basic_analytics.cpp file tells you graph statistics if you give it a graph file input
	
Find benchmark graphs
